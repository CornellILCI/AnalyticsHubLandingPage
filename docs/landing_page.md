# The CIAP

## Overview
The **C**rop **I**nnovation **A**nalytics **P**latform (CIAP) provides a 
collaborative and custom [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) environment 
where researchers can seamlessly access, analyze, and share genotype and 
phenotype data using R and Python programming environments. CIAP also comes 
pre-loaded with commonly used libraries such as:

* `sommer` for mixed model analysis
* `rTASSEL` for GWAS and exploratory genetics analyses
* `rPHG` for interacting with [PHG](https://github.com/maize-genetics/phg_v2)
  data
* `tidyverse`- and [BioConductor](https://bioconductor.org)-related libraries for 
  common data munging and bioinformatics methods
