    Link to Learning hub?

If logging in for the first time, navigate to the sign-in page at https://ciap.ilci.scienceversa.com. Use the email address you used to register and create a new password the first time you sign-in. This will be your password from now on. If you are an ILCI researcher, please contact the CIAP support team if you have not registered yet (link to form to submit with captcha).

Launch screen (not sure if on learning hub for link) 

When you first login to the CIAP, you will be directed to a JupyterHub Navigation Page or “Launcher.” The Launcher provides links to features available to you within the platform. This includes Jupyter Notebooks  preset to interpret Python or R languages. You can also choose to spin up an instance of RStudio. There are also links to the terminal, and extensions such as Templates and Notebook Jobs which will be discussed below. Click on the icon for the tool you would like to use. 
 
Your screen will also show a menu bar at the top, similar to other applications, like Word documents. You can use this toolbar to navigate to features similar to the Launcher. For example, if you click on “file”, “new”, you will see a drop down menu of different features you can open, such as a new notebook, or to re-open the launch page.  
 
Directory system

On the left hand side of your screen is a directory system. Make a new directory for yourself using your name as a label. Right click and select, ‘New Folder’. Moving forward always work within this named directory.

For organization and reproducibility everytime you start a new data analysis project, set up a directory system for your analysis. Many people use the same structure for every data project. For example:
 
-        Main directory – memorable title of your data project 
-        Subdirectories – 
data (for raw data) 
notebooks (to save your code and documentation)
output (direct output generated from your code) 
Figures (figures generated from your code)
src (if you are using scripts) 
-        README – Always include a README within each directory that describes the purpose of the directory and a description of what files are found within the directory.

Computational notebooks (link to learning hub) 

The CIAP provides access to computational notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks, which allow users to combine documentation, code, and results into one report. Code and results are recorded as the code is executed promoting reproducibility, communication of analysis and how results were obtained.  Jupyter Notebooks sit alongside data, curated and custom ILCI tools, and funded computation resources. You have everything you need in one place.
 
First navigate to your project/notebook directory. Create a notebook in the Launcher by selecting either the ‘R’ or ‘Python’ icon, depending upon which language you use. You can also create a notebook by right clicking in the directory window or by navigating to “File” and “New” Notebook. When creating a notebook from the Launcher the programming language is preset for you. Otherwise you will need to navigate to the top right corner of the notebook if you’d like to use R for coding. Click on ‘Python 3 (ipykernel)’ and in the drop down menu select ‘R’. 

Sava and name your notebook. You can do this via File -> Save Notebook, or push the save button on the top left hand corner of your notebook. You can rename by right clicking on the untitled notebook. 
 
Name your notebook something meaningful that will help you to identify the analysis later.
